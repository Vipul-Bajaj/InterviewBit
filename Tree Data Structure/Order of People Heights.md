<h1>Order of People Heights</h1>

<p>
You are given the following :

1. A positive number N
2. Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
3. Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons who are taller than P    and standing in front of P

You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height

Consider that heights will be unique

<b>Example</b>

    Input : 
    Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
    InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
    
    Output : 
    actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4 

So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him, and hence Infronts has 0 for him.

For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.

You can do similar inference for other people in the list.

```python
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def order(self, A, B):
        pairs = []
        n = len(A)
        ans = [-1]*n
        for i in range(n):
            pairs.append((A[i],B[i]))
            
        pairs.sort()
        
        aux= []
        
        for i in range(n):
            aux.append(i)
            
        for i in range(n):
            ans[aux[pairs[i][1]]] = pairs[i][0]
            del aux[pairs[i][1]]
            
        return ans
```
