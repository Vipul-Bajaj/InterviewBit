<h1>Repeating Sub-Sequence</h1>

<p>
Given a string A, find if there is any subsequence that repeats itself.

A subsequence of a string is defined as a sequence of characters generated by deleting some characters in the string without changing the order of the remaining characters.

    NOTE : sub-sequence length should be greater than or equal to 2.
<b>Input Format:</b>

    The first and the only argument of input contains a string A.
<b>Output Format:</b>

    Return an integer, 0 or 1:
    => 0 : False
    => 1 : True
<b>Constraints:</b>

    1 <= length(A) <= 100
<b>Example:</b>

    Input 1:
        A = "abab"

    Output 1:
        1

    Explanation 1:
        "ab" is repeated.

    Input 2:
        A = "abba"
        
    Output 2:
        0

    Explanation 2:
        There is no repeating subsequence.

```python
class Solution:
    # @param A : string
    # @return an integer
    def anytwo(self, A):
        n = len(A)
    
        if n<=2:
            return 0
            
        lcs = [[0 for j in range(n+1)]for i in range(n+1)]
        
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for j in range(1,n+1):
                if i==j:
                    lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i-1][j],lcs[i][j-1])
                elif A[i-1] == A[j-1]:
                    lcs[i][j] = lcs[i-1][j-1]+1
                else:
                    lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i-1][j],lcs[i][j-1])
                    
        return 1 if lcs[n][n]>1 else 0
